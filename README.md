# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
"How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras! Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth. Mantras are repetive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. Your challenge is to build an app that helps users remind themselves of their inherent value!"

This solo project is creating an app that allows users to choose to view an affirmation or mantra, as well as create their own affirmation and/or mantra. 

### Installation Instructions:

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
##### Wins: 
- Having the app closely match the comp 
- Learning about the checked property of radio buttons
- Using `classList` appropriately 
- Creating a form within the app
- Completing the project individually

##### Challenges: 
- Understanding `event.preventDefault()` was difficult at first, but I will continue to research on this topic!
- Asking for help is normally out of my comfort zone, but I pushed myself to ask for help when necesssary
